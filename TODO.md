This is a technical documentation outline for a smart learning platform designed to manage educational operations for students, lecturers, and various administrative departments. It uses a component-based microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability, with specialized modules handling different functionalities.
System overview
The Smart Learning Platform is a web-based and mobile-accessible application that digitizes and streamlines university operations, from course registration to student progression. The system is built around several interconnected modules, each handling specific functionalities while ensuring secure, role-based access for all users.
Core modules
User and Access Management: Manages all user accounts (students, lecturers, admins) and enforces role-based permissions.
Course Management: Handles the lifecycle of academic courses, including creation, modification, and content delivery.
Registration and Enrollment: Manages the student course registration process.
Assignment and Quiz Handling: Supports the creation, submission, and grading of assessments.
Communication: Facilitates real-time interaction through chat rooms and meeting scheduling features.
Student Progression: Tracks and manages student academic progress, including promotions and degree completion.
Integration Services: Connects the platform with other university systems (e.g., Student Information System, Finance).
Key actors
Student: Registers for courses, submits assignments, takes quizzes, attends meetings, and participates in chat rooms.
Lecturer: Creates and manages courses, designs quizzes and assignments, grades submissions, and communicates with students.
Departmental Admin: Manages department-specific courses, assigns lecturers, and oversees student registrations within their department.
Faculty Admin: Administers all departments and courses within a faculty, handles exceptions, and reviews departmental reports.
Senate Admin: Has a system-wide overview, manages all faculties, and handles university-level academic rules and policies.
System architecture
The platform uses a microservices architecture to ensure high availability, scalability, and modularity.
Frontend: A responsive, cross-platform user interface (UI) built with a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue.js), accessible via web browsers and mobile apps.
Backend: A collection of microservices, each handling a specific module (e.g., Course Service, User Service, Communication Service).
API Gateway: Routes and manages all incoming API requests to the appropriate microservices.
Database: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is used for structured data (users, courses), while a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) is used for less-structured data (chat messages).
Real-time Communication Service: A dedicated WebSocket service manages live communication features like chat and meeting handling.
Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and authorization using a standard protocol like OAuth2 or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Module documentation
Course management
Purpose: Enable lecturers and admins to manage all aspects of a course.
Lecturer functionalities:
Create a new course and define its details (title, description, syllabus).
Upload course materials in various formats (PDF, video, presentations).
Create, schedule, and publish assignments and quizzes.
Publish grades and provide feedback on submitted work.
Admin functionalities:
Create or retire course offerings.
Assign and remove lecturers from courses.
View course enrollment statistics.
Data schema (CourseService.db): Includes tables for Courses, CourseMaterials, Assignments, and Quizzes, with foreign keys linking to the Users table for lecturers.
Course registration
Purpose: Allow students to register for courses during specified periods.
Process flow:
Student: Views available courses and checks eligibility.

Purpose: Facilitate the creation, submission, and automated or manual grading of academic assessments.
Functionalities:
Assignment Submission: Students submit files, and the system records the timestamp and stores the submission securely.
Quiz Engine: Lecturers create quizzes with multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions. The engine automatically grades objective questions.
Plagiarism Detection: (Optional) Integration with a third-party service to check assignments for plagiarism.
Data schema (AssessmentService.db): Tables include Quizzes, QuizQuestions, StudentSubmissions, and Grades.
Meeting handling
Purpose: Allow users to schedule and conduct virtual meetings.
Technical design:
Integration: Uses a third-party video conferencing service (e.g., Jitsi, Zoom SDK) for video/audio streams.
API: The platform communicates with the meeting service via REST APIs to create, manage, and retrieve meeting data.
Functionality:
Users can schedule and join meetings directly from the platform.
Integration with user calendars for notifications.
Data schema (CommunicationService.db): Tables include Meetings, MeetingParticipants, and MeetingRecordings.
Chat rooms
Purpose: Provide real-time communication channels for courses, departments, and other user groups.
Technical design:

Scalability: Implements a pub/sub model to handle a large number of concurrent users and messages.
Functionality:
Course-based Chats: Automatic creation of chat rooms for each course enrollment.
Group Chats: Users can create custom group chats.
Persistent Storage: Messages are stored in a database for message history.
Data schema (CommunicationService.db): Tables include ChatRooms, Messages, and ChatParticipants.
Student progression integration
Purpose: Automate the tracking and management of student academic status.
Process:
Data Aggregation: The module pulls data from the Grades and Enrollments tables to calculate a student's standing.
Status Update: Uses predefined university rules to automatically update a student's status (e.g., promoted, at-risk, graduated).
Admin Dashboard: Provides faculty and senate admins with analytics and dashboards to monitor student progress across departments and faculties.
Data schema (ProgressionService.db): Tables include StudentProgressRecords, AcademicRules, and ProgressionLogs.
Deployment
The application is deployed using cloud-native technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for scalability and reliability.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines ensure code changes are automatically tested and deployed.
The use of a secure, cloud-hosted environment ensures high availability and regular data backups.
